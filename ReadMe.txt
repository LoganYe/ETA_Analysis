ReadMe:Before running the code, put train.csv and test.csv into data folder.For all the codes in src:
knn.py is for the knn model,  which can save the output into output_knn.csv in the output folder.dbScan.py and Kmeans.py can do the clustering before the STL.dbScan.py could plot a graph stored in output folder while Kmeans could store two files which contains point_id, minIndex, minDist ** 2 for each points in start points set and end points set.plot_point.py could plot two graphs which contains all the start points and end points separately.stl.py and stl2.py did all the plotting for the time series analysis which still unfinished. (fit the curve myself).Author: Gaoyang YeEmail: logan.yegaoyang@gmail.comDate: Jan 6th, 2017
